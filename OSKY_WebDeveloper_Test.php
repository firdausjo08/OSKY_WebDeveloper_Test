        <p>The celebration was pure Mariano Rivera. No big screams or wild gestures. Certainly no spectacle, even if Rivera is widely regarded as the best ever at what he does. Just warm hugs and appreciative handshakes from Yankees teammates. And even that might have been more than what Rivera wanted following the 600th save of his remarkable career.
